This is sum of what i have done.
14.11.22
2-nd day of development, hoping i will end main gameplay soon.
Trying to make connection to another page with saving gameId.

Yes, i made gameId working! now making connection to sockets.

17.11.22
5-th day. Websockets are confirmed working. Text on cards changes for both players simultaneously.
Next step is to add some cards working. Players must have ability to take cards from their deck.
I have to make cards, make their basic abilities, like attack and health.
Make deck and hand for everyplayer.
Make ability to take cards from the deck, no more then five.
That's a long task, so let's go.

21.11.22
9-th day. Make players' ability to take cards from deck took more than i thought.
Next step is to make cards drag'n'drop on the battlefield! It must be a bit easer to do...
